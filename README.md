## What is it?

A ridiculous JavaScript "game" in the style of the old school point-and-click adventures from Lucasarts, Sierra etc.

## What does it need to run?

It's packaged to run straight from a (JavaScript enabled) browser
with File --> Open or file:/// or what have you.

## What's hot?

* Kind of quirky I guess!
* Comical *leveraging* of Google Map's Street View images

## What's not?

* Ancient JavaScript
* Game is unfinished
* These kind of game engines are usually no good without a scripting system
